# Anomaly Detection Framework for Industrial Vision

This repository contains the code related to our anomaly detection framework that uses an autoencoder trained on images corrupted with our Stain-shaped noise. The full paper is available on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12977) and will be soon presented at ICPR2020. 

Illustration belows presents an overview of anomaly dectection results obtained with our method (AESc + Stain) on some samples of the MVTec AD [dataset](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/).
